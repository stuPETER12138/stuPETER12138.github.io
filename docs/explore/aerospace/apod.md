## Explanation
    
This stunning portrait of NGC 5335 was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope（哈勃太空望远镜）.  Some 170,000 light-years（光年） across and over 200 million light-years away toward the constellation Virgo（室女座）, the magnificent spiral galaxy（螺旋星系） is seen face-on in Hubble's view. Within the galactic disk（星系盘）, loose streamers of star forming regions（恒星形成区） lie along the galaxy's flocculent spiral arms（絮状旋臂）. But the most striking feature of NGC 5335 is its prominent central bar（中心棒状结构）. Seen in about 30 percent of galaxies, including our Milky Way（银河系）, bar structures are understood to channel material inward toward the galactic center（星系中心）, fueling star formation. Of course, distant background galaxies（背景星系） are easy to spot, scattered around the sharp Hubble image. Launched in 1990, Hubble is now celebrating its 35th year exploring the cosmos（宇宙） from orbit around planet Earth.
