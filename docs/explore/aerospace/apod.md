## Explanation
    
How do black holes create X-rays（X射线）? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA’s IXPE（成像X射线偏振探测器） satellite. X-rays（X射线） cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic（高能的） environment nearby, in particular by a jet（喷流） of particles moving outward. By observing X-ray（X射线） light arriving from near the supermassive（超大质量的） black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar（耀变体）, it was discovered that these X-rays（X射线） lacked significant polarization（偏振）, which is expected when created more by energetic（高能的） electrons than protons. In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet（喷流） is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk（吸积盘） circling the black hole. Understanding highly energetic（高能的） processes across the universe helps humanity to understand similar processes that occur on or near our Earth.   Put it All Together: Astronomy Puzzle of the Day
